                    <p class='large-text'>Hi, I'm Zach. Fueled by boundless enthusiasm, endless curiousity and LOTS of coffee.</p>
                    <p>There have been many jokes about my being the "Zach of All Trades", but the name is kind of sticking. Between an engineering degree, tech consulting with companies in almost a dozen countries and a mind for entrepreneurship, the deck is starting stack. Did I mention that I love video? Add marketing as another skill set.</p>
                    <p>I have always defined myself by the work that I want to do and the last year has been a very exciting transition in that regard. After years of looking on enviously at my developer friends, I am finally making the transition to a fully technical role in the software development space.</p>
                    <p>Focusing primarily on the MERN stack, it has been pure joy to dive headlong into the wonderful world of software engineering. Check out my projects page to check out some of my projects!</p>
                    <p>I like to develop expertise in a wide arena of skills to be the most dynamic professional I can be. Having worked in the startup space for most of the last decade, this has proven to be quite the boon! My personality type is I/ENTP. I am currently seeking a web developer or software engineering position and would love to chat!</p>
